## AS3

Application Services 3 Extension is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a BIG-IP system.
AS3 uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands.
The declaration represents the configuration which AS3 is responsible for creating on a BIG-IP system.
